# React Train Frontend for Vendo API

This is the frontend for a train search application. You can search for train stations, get suggestions, and view real-time arrivals and departures. The app provides information about where trains are coming from, any delays, and which platform they will depart from.

## Technologies used

- React + Typescript for building components
- SCSS for custom styling, like tables
- MUI for prebuilt suggestion component to search for train stations and set the input time span
- Vite has been used for setting up the whole application

## How to get started

- clone the repository
- npm install
- npm run dev
- App should run on http://localhost:5173/

Also make sure that you have installed the backend which serves the frontend with our train data.

You can find the repo for the backend here: https://github.com/alexanderley/train-backend

# Important!

Make sure the application runs on the exact port http://localhost:5173 otherwise there might be a CORS error from the backend.
